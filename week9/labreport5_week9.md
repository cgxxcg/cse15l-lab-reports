# Lab report 5

## Part 1

Student:  I'm trying to read in the integer from "input.txt" and keep track of the count and sum. But I'm getting some weird output that I can't figure out. 
I think the problem might be an issue with how I'm reading the input file. <br>

TA: Hi, you can find a way to figure out what happens to the variables inside the loop. There is a simple way to do it and show the result in the terminal!

I printed out the count and sum inside the loop and it seems everything is working. I realized tht
